# DarkStoreManagement

This repository now includes a simple **Daywise Growth Tracker** web application.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The app allows you to add notes for each day and stores them on the server in `data.json` (ignored by Git). You can also delete previous entries.
